In our twelve hundred by eight hundred pixel Canvas, we developed a visually appealing animated image. Creating Triangles, Squares, Circles, Trapezoids, and Hexagons, we utilized javascript random number functions to "randomize" which shape of the four appears, as well as what color the shape will be out of a combination of reds, greens, and blues. Before each shape is drawn, we included a timed delay  for a tenth of a second with "setTimeout" functions. To add extra flare, we included a downloaded audio file in our "main" function that begins playing when the canvas loads. Our background for the page is a subdued blue-gray, with a slightly shadowed, black text heading all chosen to prevent detraction from the Canvas.
