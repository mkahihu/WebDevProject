# WebDevProject

In our Canvas, we developed a visually appealing animated image. With Triangles, Rectangles, Circles, and Hexagons, we utilized javascript random number functions to "randomize" which shape of the four appears, as well as what color the shape will be out of a combination of reds, greens, and blues. Before each shape is drawn, we included a timed delay for a tenth of a second. To add extra flare, we included a downloaded audio file that begins playing when the canvas loads. Our background for the page is a subdued, blue-gray, with a slightly shadowed, black text heading all designed to prevent detraction from the Canvas.
